Here's a list of all the material you need. Again, for more details, refer to my youtube.

- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

- Arduino Uno (Or any arduino microcontrollers)

- 9g Servo (Mine is a 360 servo. If you have a standard servo, you need to adjust the code slightly)

- Breadboard

- USB type A to USB type B cable

- Jumper wires
